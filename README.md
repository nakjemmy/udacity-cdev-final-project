# Serverless Recipe App

This is a simple Recipe App built with the Serverless Framework and the React Web Library.

# Functionality of the application

This application allows creating/removing/updating/fetching Recipes for an authenticated User. Each Recipe item can optionally have an attachment image. Each user only has access to Recipe items that he/she has created.

# Prerequisites

- <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/" target="_blank">NodeJS</a> version up to 14.xx

# How to run the application

To run a client application run the following commands:

```
cd client
npm install
npm run start
```

This should start a development server with the React application that will interact with the serverless Recipe application.
